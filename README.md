# US-Accomodation-in-Boston-Hawaii-Chicago
In this project, I wanted to create an application using Shine App that would allow the user to interactively select locations to stay based on the price range and one of the three available cities.

The project includes three tabs: data input and a map of objects, a scatter plot showing the relationship between the number of reviews and the price of accommodation, and a table dispplaying all information based on the user's choice.

Since the code is compact, I decided to combine the UI and server parts. Nevertheless, in the future I plan to further ivestigate the functionality of such applications, experimenting with different libraries, and dividing the code into several files to increase performance.

# Recommendations for users
On the first tab (input and maps)the user selects a city (one of three: Chicago, Hawaii or Boston), as well as the price range of accommodation per night. The user can immediately evaluate the result of his\her choice on the interactive map, which is located on the same tab and takes into account the data of the user choice.
On the second tab(plot), the user can select a color for the chart, as well as select a checkbox for the chart to include a linear trend.
On the third tab (table), the user can download the table in .csv format by clicking on the "Download" button.The same tab displays a table with all filtering results.

# Inspiration for other programmers.
This application can be extended to other cities in the United States, since the dataset was taken from the public domain and includes a variety of options for housing on the AirBNB
